# MoneyManager

MoneyManager is a multi banking Java Application that can be used by users to track all their monetary assets on different platforms.

## Development
The Application is still in development. It already supports a varierty of specific plattforms like european banks using HBCI, several crypto currencies addresses and Coinbase.
After the first start of the application the database is created (in debug mode). The credentials of the supported platforms need to be added to this database in order to be used by the application.
